- A game
      - A function to print the map onto the screen

      - A function to get input from the user(maybe do this on each
      function that needs input individually?)

      - function to update and save user score
     
      - function to get input from the user

      - Function to update the user's life and kill the user in case some events 
      happen. How to kill the user?
          - Maybe the user's x and y positions on the map
          should be stored in a struct(just the first quadrant of the .. 
          should be used, the values should only be positive).

      - Should updating the user be a functionality of the input function or in another
      function which the input handling function calls?

     - Function to read and print the user's scores stored on a file
          - The file is a binary file. For each position on the leaderboard,
          we have a line(or a sequence of bytes separated by newline characters on the
          file). Each line contains a name, then a ; and the score of the user, 
          an int(scores can be negative)

     - Function to read data about a game from a file and load it

- Structuring
     - Data file structure
          - Lines. Each line will mandatorily contain the following data:
               - user's nick
               - user's score

          - Each line can also contain an extra field, storing the map state for the
          last game


- Map updating
     - requirements: 
          1. updates the map.
               - Obstacles can either have the number 3 or 4. 
               - User is identified by number 1 
               - Objective is identified by number 2

- Bonus
     - Requirements
          1. First we need to define which elements of the map we will use as obstacles 
          and which for bonuses.

          2. Collected bonus should be removed from the map

          3. Add the bonus value for collecting the object to the user's score
     - Functions needed
          - Function that returns an address to the variable storing the user's bonus
               NOTE: This can be easily resolved using a struct to store information 
               about the user, like score and stuff
     
     - Functionality
          - Given a way to access the user's bonus data, we should update
          it according to the instructions
               - The bonus given for reaching the goal should 
               be greater than the bonuses spread around the map

               - The position in the map on which the bonus was is deleted(maybe we can generate
               another object randomly, which could be another bonus or an obstacle)

When shall we enter raw mode?
     - When updating the map.
     - When reading user input to move the user.

When not to use raw mode?
     - At menus.

User data struct
      - x and y values on the map
      - user score
      - number of lives remaining

      - We need a function to initialize this struct. It will take the variables
      with the data and a pointer(or return it)
